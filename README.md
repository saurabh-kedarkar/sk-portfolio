Simple Portfolio Template
This repository provides a template for sharing work as an online portfolio (website). It was designed primarily for Data Scientists sharing their R projects, with each project representing an html file (such as the product of knitting Rmd) or a website (such as produced by a shiny app).

The template portfolio is a simple example built with hugo derived from the forty theme.

To see a website using this template, check out this example: https://hugo-portfolio-example.netlify.app/

Inspired by Emi Tanaka's Showcase page: https://emitanaka.org/showcase/
